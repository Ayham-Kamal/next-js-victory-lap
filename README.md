# Next.js + PostgreSQL Auth Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication of email + password login, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) as the ORM, and a [Neon Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) database to persist the data.

-- Users can use this application to keep track of their daily exercises at the gym. Also they can register to different classes offered at the gym.

# Future Plans:
-- Add callbacks functions that display suitable messages when the user sign in with wrong credentials.
-- Add more ways of keeping track of exercise progress such as: water drank, calories burned, ...etc.
-- Add different authorization to users based on whether they are regualar users, trainers, or admins.
